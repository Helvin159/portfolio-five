# Portfolio Five - Next.js App for MrRymer.tech

Portfolio Five is a personal project developed by [Your Name] to showcase a collection of work and projects. The primary focus of this portfolio is to demonstrate proficiency in various languages, frameworks, and content management systems (CMS). The project is a Next.js app built for an already existing WordPress instance, MrRymer.tech, to display the work in different formats.

## Project Overview

  - JavaScript
  - SCSS
  - CSS

- **Backend:**

## How It Works

Portfolio Five acts as an interactive portfolio that fetches project data from the headless WordPress instance, MrRymer.tech. The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and provides a smooth user experience.

The GraphQL integration facilitates efficient data retrieval from the WordPress backend, allowing for dynamic content updates without the need for traditional WordPress templates.
